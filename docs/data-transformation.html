<p>We’d like to join our datasets to see both the violations and the ratings. To accomplish that, we first convert all restaurants names to lower cases with <code>tolower()</code>, then strip symbols off on two datasets with <code>sub()</code> to create uniform syntax for names. After that, we used <code>sqldf</code> package to count the number of violations each restaurant has and join the two datasets together as our final dataset.</p>
<p>We can take a glance at the final dataset.</p>

## 3 Danji showcases authentic Korean flavors prepared with classic techniques to enhance the taste, textures, and aesthetic of each dish. We offer small but shareable portions served in multiple courses, allowing diners to enjoy each dish hot out of the kitchen. Above all, Danji, from its decor to its music, represents our idea of a great place to enjoy amazing food.At Danji and Hanjan we choose to use meat raised with no antibiotics or growth hormones. Our fish are caught wild and are not overfished and endangered. We try to use as much organic and local produce as possible and certainly do not use chemicals, such as MSG, to enhance flavors. No doubt these ingredients cost more but we believe the food we consume should be healthy and responsible as well as delicious.

<p>While the above final dataset contains information about restaurants which had violation records, in order to faciliate the interaction part of this project, we are going to create <code>cleaned_restaurants</code> and <code>cleaned_violations</code> datasets, so that we can 1.find each restaruant’s violation total count (including 0) 2.boil down the large original violations file so the new file only contains restaurant week’s restaurants’ specific violation information.</p>
