Provide people with easy access to visualizaed restaurant information; map the restaurant onto NYC map for geographical distribution; explore any interesting relationship between restaurant reviews and health inspection data. Our project uses two restaurant datasets we scraped. One is from Opentable, another one is the inspection data from the Health Department. First, we want to provide an interacitve user interface such that people can easily get a through information of a restaurant, including its detailed reviews and how the restaurant performed during the inspections. Second, we want to see the geographical distribution of the restaurants by inspection results. By mapping the restaurants into the NYC map, we can identify which neighborhood have the cleanest restaurants and which neighborhood has not so clean restaurants. It is also more convenient for people who just want to focus on their on neighborhoods. Finally, we want to investigate the overall relationship between restaurants’ public reviews and the performance during the inspection. We would like to know if popular restaurants generally meet the health requirements. Besides that we would also like to see if there is any unexpected trend. For example, is there any very poorly reviewed restaurant that got exceptionally good reviews during inspections? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources We are using two datasets for our project. The first one is an inspection results data, where we downloaded the dataset from the official website. The second dataset is restaurant review dataset during last restaurant week. We scraped this dataset from Opentable using rvest. We first get the name of restaurants participating in the NYC restaurant week. Then we use the name we got to scrape detailed information that we need. The scraped data contains 9 columns: food_review, ambience_review value_review, service_review, price_range review_count, average_review, restaurant_main_type. The detailed information like review scores are scraped from the restaurant page. The way we scraped data was that we restrict the region into Manhattan area so that most restaurants will appear in the health inspection data. Since there are 3 pages of restaurants, we used url to do page indexing. Then we constructed a loop with page numbers. In side this loop we have a nested loop that use the restaurant names we got froim this page to modify the url. We did some regex on the names so that they can fit the way opentable use them. For each column we append each value into a list. After we finish the nested loop, we will combine all the lists we have into our final dataset. Following is the code for our scaping script: There is not scraping process for our inspection data. The data contains grade, score, date of the inspection, violation description and the restaurant name. Our further task is to join these two datasets, and explore some interesting relationship between these two.

Jim and David, architect Richard Lewis and landscape architect Robin Key, preserved the Victorian/ Gothic elegance of the semi-circular building; it is authentic, natural, elegant and sexy. It has been re-built to spectacular precision and the décor is of a grand farmhouse one might find on the property of an Italian Villa or a historic Hudson River Valley mansion. ## 3 ABC Kitchen with Jean-Georges: passionately committed to offering the freshest organic and local ingredients possible.ABC Kitchen presents a changing menu that is locally sourced and globally artistic in a fresh and articulate space. ## restaurant_main_type latitude longitude postal_code ## 1 Contemporary American 40.80113 -73.96819 10025 ## 2 American 40.77219 -73.97772 10023 ## 3 Contemporary American 40.73790 -73.98950 10003 Then, we check the number of NA’s in each column. ## name street_address google_map ## 0 0 0 ## review_count phone website ## 0 0 2 ## restaurant_type average_review food_review ## 0 0 0 ## service_review ambience_review value_review ## 0 0 0 ## price_range star_1 star_2 ## 0 0 0 ## star_3 star_4 star_5 ## 0 0 0 ## description restaurant_main_type latitude ## 0 0 0 ## longitude postal_code ## 0 1 There are 5 NA’s in each review columns.
